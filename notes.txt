Alterior Game Designs:
	- there should probably be a system by which you can trade resources for things
	- maybe destroying monsters leads to draws, or having monsters destroyed leads to draws
	- there needs to be slightly more drawing, it has to be good chances to encounter all cards once

Thinking about deck builds:
	the sacrifice mechanic is ideal, the best reason to play weaker monsters
	monsters like "kuriboh" paired with "tourguide from the underworld", sangan, "witch of the black forest"
		ect are great combos to keep cards in the hand.
		Those cards also make for good components for a ritual monster, like BLS

	No hand traps at all
