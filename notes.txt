Need a Board:
	- moster card zones
	- spell and trap 


Alterior Game Designs:
	- there should probably be a system by which you can trade resources for things
	- maybe destroying monsters leads to draws, or having monsters destroyed leads to draws
	- there needs to be slightly more drawing, it has to be good chances to encounter all cards once
